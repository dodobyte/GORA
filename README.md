# GORA

## Top-Down space shooter game demo

This was my first Go project. It's a single level top-down space shooter. 

You need SDL2 and [go-sdl2](https://github.com/veandco/go-sdl2) binding to build it. If you just want to play, you can download binary distribution [here](dogankurt.com/gora.zip).

Here are some screenshots
